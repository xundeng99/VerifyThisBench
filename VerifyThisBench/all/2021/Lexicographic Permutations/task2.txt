The verification challenges related to the permut procedure are:
6. Verify that permut is memory safe.
7. Verify that permut terminates for every input.
8. Verify that any permutation reported by permut is unique.
9. Verify that permut(A) reports all permutations of A.
10. Verify that permut outputs all permututations in lexicographic order.
