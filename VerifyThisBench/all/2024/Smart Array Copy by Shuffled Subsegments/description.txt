This challenge concerns array copy function(s) broadly inspired by real life implementations that aim to resist certain side-channel attacks. Their aim is to
copy all array elements from one array to another array of the same length.
This could be achieved with a simple loop through the array indices in order.
However, to obfuscate the sequence of memory accesses performed, we aim to
shuffle some of the operations performed on the arrays, as described below:
