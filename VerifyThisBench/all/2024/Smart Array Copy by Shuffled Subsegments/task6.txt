Extension: Smart Array Copy version 1 In some settings, preserving
the order of elements may not be important. In this case, we can obfuscate yet
further by also shuffling the order of elements as they are copied, as follows: (a) Specify a function (or other operation) Permute which, when invoked, returns a (random, unknown) permutation. You do not need to implement this function, but itâ€™s important to make clear how you represent permutations (or their properties) in your specification/modelling of Permute.
