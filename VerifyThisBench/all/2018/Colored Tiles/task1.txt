Verification tasks. You should verify that at the end, count[50] will contain the right number.
Hint: Since the algorithm works by enumerating the valid colorings, we expect you to give a nice
specification of a valid coloring and to prove the following properties:
1. Each coloring counted by the algorithm is valid.
2. No coloring is counted twice.
3. No valid coloring is missed.
