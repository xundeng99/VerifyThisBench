Verification tasks. Verify the following properties:
3. member(k) == false, if no insert(k) that returned true can have been
executed.
You are free to re-phrase properties 3, but make sure you can prove
things like:
insert(1) || insert(2) || insert(3);
{ assert(member(1) and !member(42)) } || insert(4) || insert(5);
