Verification tasks. Verify the following properties:
2. member(k) == true, if insert(k) has been executed before (and returned
true)
You are free to re-phrase properties 2 but make sure you can prove
things like:
insert(1) || insert(2) || insert(3);
{ assert(member(1) and !member(42)) } || insert(4) || insert(5);
