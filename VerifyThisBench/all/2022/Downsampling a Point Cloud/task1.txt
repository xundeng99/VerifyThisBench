Implementation task. Implement the downsample method. The pseudocode
uses real numbers but participants may simplify and use integers if their tool
does not have adequate support for real numbers. Other potential simplifications include requiring that the least point is at (0, 0, 0) and fixed parameters
for x_max, y_max and z_max.
