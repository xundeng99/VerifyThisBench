This challenge is an instance of Kaldewaijâ€™s Search by Elimination [10], where an element with
a given property is located by eliminating elements that do not have that
property. The challenge was selected
as it involves a relatively simple but
interesting invariant, expressing that the maximal element is in the remaining
search space rather than maintaining the maximal element found so far.
public static int max(int[] a) {
int x = 0;
int y = a.length-1;
while (x != y) {
if (a[x] <= a[y]) x++;
else y--;
}
return x;
}
