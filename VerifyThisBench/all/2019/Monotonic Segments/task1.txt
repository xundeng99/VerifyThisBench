Implementation task. Implement the algorithm shown above to compute
monotonic cutpoints of an input sequence. Choose any representation of input
sequence and cutpoints sequence that is manageable using your programming
language of choice: arrays, mathematical sequences, dynamic lists, . . . . If you
are using a functional programming language, you can use recursion instead
of looping to implement the general idea behind the algorithm.
