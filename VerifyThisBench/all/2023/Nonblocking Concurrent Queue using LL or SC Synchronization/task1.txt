These can be done in any order. Simplify or add assumptions as needed. The first set of tasks use only the enqueue operation: 1. In your favorite language, write a program P incorporating Evéquoz's FIFO queue (only the enqueue operation is needed). The queue is initially empty. P generates NT threads (NT ≥ 1), with IDs 0, ..., NT-1. Each thread calls enqueue on its thread ID, then terminates.
